This repository contains the code and reference dataset used to evaluating deep learning methods applied to Landsat time series subsequences to detect and classify boreal forest disturbances events: the challenge of partial and progressive disturbances. The dataset served as the training data for implementing Transformer and TempCNN models to classify forest disturbances in the boreal forest of eastern Canada.
