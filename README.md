This repository contains the code and reference dataset used to evaluating deep learning methods applied to Landsat time series subsequences to detect and classify boreal forest disturbances events: the challenge of partial and progressive disturbances (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2024.114107). The dataset served as the training data for implementing Transformer and TempCNN models to classify forest disturbances in the boreal forest of eastern Canada.
